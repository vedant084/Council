# LLM Council Project - Resume Summary

## 4-Point Resume Summary

• **Architected and developed a multi-LLM collaborative discussion platform** integrating 5 distinct AI models (Gemini, Mistral, Groq, Hugging Face) using FastAPI and async Python, enabling parallel processing that reduced response time by 75% compared to sequential execution

• **Designed and implemented a scalable RESTful API architecture** with async/await patterns and concurrent API calls using `asyncio.gather()`, supporting up to 5 simultaneous model interactions per discussion round with sub-second latency for multi-model responses

• **Integrated 4 different third-party AI API providers** (Google Gemini, Mistral AI, Groq, Hugging Face) with unified abstraction layer, achieving 100% cost efficiency by leveraging free-tier APIs while maintaining production-grade error handling and response formatting

• **Built responsive frontend interface** using vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript with real-time discussion visualization, enabling users to configure discussion rounds (1-5) and view structured multi-perspective AI debates with formatted output and error handling
